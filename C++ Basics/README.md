# C++ Basics

Welcome to the C++ Basics folder! This folder is designed to help beginners get started with C++ programming. Here, you will find examples of how to take input and display output, how to use if-else statements, loops, classes, and other fundamental concepts.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The folder is organized into the following files and subdirectories:

### 📚 Basic Input/Output
- **[Basic_inputoutput.cpp](Basic_inputoutput.cpp)**: Finding the hypotenuse given base and altitude.

### 📚 If-Else Statements
- **[BMI_Calculator.cpp](If-Else/BMI_Calculator.cpp)**: Calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) and determine the category.
- **[LeapYear.cpp](If-Else/LeapYear.cpp)**: Determine if a given year is a leap year.
- **[RootsOfQE.cpp](If-Else/RootsOfQE.cpp)**: Find the nature of the roots of a quadratic equation.

### 📚 Loops
- **[ForLoop.cpp](Loops/ForLoop.cpp)**: Example of using a for loop.
- **[WhileLoop.cpp](Loops/WhileLoop.cpp)**: Example of using a while loop.

### 📚 Classes
- **[BasicClass.cpp](Classes/BasicClass.cpp)**: Example of defining and using a basic class.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To compile and run the C++ programs, you need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- A basic understanding of C++ syntax
