# DSA Learning with C++

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning repository! 🚀 This repository documents my journey of mastering DSA concepts using C++, following the DSA-for-Interviews-GirlScript-EOP course. Each file demonstrates implementations of various data structures and algorithms, with clear and concise code, created for educational purposes.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### 🔗 Linked List
- **[Initialize_a_LinkedList.cpp](LinkedList/Initialize_a_LinkedList.cpp)**: Create and initialize a basic linked list.
- **[Printing_Elements.cpp](LinkedList/Printing_Elements.cpp)**: Print elements of a linked list.
- **[InsertAtHead.cpp](LinkedList/InsertAtHead.cpp)**: Insert a node at the beginning of a linked list.
- **[InsertAtTail.cpp](LinkedList/InsertAtTail.cpp)**: Insert a node at the end of a linked list.
- **[InsertAtPosition.cpp](LinkedList/InsertAtPosition.cpp)**: Insert a node at a specific position.
- **[Deleting_Head.cpp](LinkedList/Deleting_Head.cpp)**: Delete the head node.
- **[Deleteing_Tail.cpp](LinkedList/Deleteing_Tail.cpp)**: Delete the tail node.
- **[Delete_given_position.cpp](LinkedList/Delete_given_position.cpp)**: Delete a node at a specified position.

   git clone https://github.com/prabhakarchaulagain09/Cpp_basics.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Cpp_basics
   ```
3. **Compile and Run**:
   Compile any `.cpp` file of your choice using your preferred compiler. For example:
   ```bash
   g++ LinkedList/InsertAtHead.cpp -o InsertAtHead
   ./InsertAtHead
   ```
